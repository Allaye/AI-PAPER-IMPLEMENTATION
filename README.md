> This repository contains examples of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in **Python** using pytorch

The purpose of this repository is _not_ to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3<sup>rd</sup> party library one-liners _but_ rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That's why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.



## Machine Learning Map

The source of the following machine learning topics map is [this wonderful blog post](https://vas3k.ru/blog/machine_learning/)

## Prerequisites

#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

#### Working with projects and Installing Dependencies

Each project comes with their personal requirements.txt so one can use that to set up their environment, this is based on what you want though

## Datasets

The project normally wont contain any data for training, all most all dataset used for this training are downloaded from the pytorch framework.

## Supporting the project

You may support this project via ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/allaye) .
This repo contains codes of research papers based on the field of ML/DL/NLP/CV/GAN. etc,  using Python and Pytorch framework.

The purpose of this repository is to implement machine learning algorithms not by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch using pytorch. This algorithms are not going to be the best performing ones but they sure teach us alot.

Each algorithm section contains code that can be run as a modules,the repo does not make use of notebooks but you can convert them if you want. in case you are interested in one particular section you can just use the code from that section, all section will be stand alone, meaning they wont depend on anyother thing.
